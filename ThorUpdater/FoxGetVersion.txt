### 2024-10-06

- Packages.dbf was replaced with Packages.xml for easier comparison and merging.

- Merged pull request #7, which provides automatic updating of FoxGetPackages.dbf.

- Added a Clear Filter button.

- Updated installer versions.

- Fixed a bug that caused an error clicking *Show only installed packages* when there aren't any. Also, in that case, the list now displays nothing rather than all packages.

- Handled failure to unzip a downloaded file better.

- FoxGet no longer adds a file to the project if it's already there when installing or tries to remove it when uninstalling.

- Logging is now done when uninstalling a package.

- Error 35 no longer occurs when downloading the packages file (note: this is actually a change in VFPXInternet.prg, which is part of [VFPX Framework](https://github.com/VFPX/VFPXFramework)). Thanks to Christof Wollenhaupt for the fix.
